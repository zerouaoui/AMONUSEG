# AMONuSeg: A Histological Dataset for African Multi-Organ Nuclei Semantic Segmentation.

* 48 H&E histological images with a size of 1280x960 and 250x Magnification Factor.
* 4 body parts: Breast, Skin, Cervical and Inguinal.
* 19,036 annotated nuclei.
* Collected using digital microscopic camera (MA 500 AmScope Matlab Â®, USA) .


# Process 
Two trained annotators performed manual annotation following the steps bellow:

* Unsupervised automatic nuclei segmentation masks are generated using Fiji ImageJ software to provide rough preliminary annotations for tissue slides.
* Manual annotation was performed using LabelStudio tool. 
* Intra Observation to validate the annotations by the two trained annotators.
* Validation of the annotations by three experts' anatomists and pathologists. 
* In case of disagreements, provide two masks for the annotated image.
